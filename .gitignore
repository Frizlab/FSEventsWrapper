# The SPM build folder
/.build/
# This folder is used by SPM when a package is put in “edit” mode (`swift
# package edit some_package`): the edited package is moved in this folder, and
# removed when the package is “unedited” (`swift package unedit some_package`).
/Packages/

# Contains a bunch of stuff… should usually be ignored I think. Currently, as
# far as I’m aware, it is used by Xcode 11 to put the autogenerated Xcode
# project created and maintained by Xcode when opening a Package.swift file, and
# by the `swift package config` command to store its config (currently, the only
# config I’m aware of are the mirrors for downloading packages).
